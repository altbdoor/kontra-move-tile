# kontra-move-tile

A simple demonstration of how to implement a tile-based movement in Kontra, and to a certain extent, any game engine. Added some animations too since that's fun.

I wrote a little about it in [here](https://github.com/altbdoor/today-i-learned/blob/master/topics/Tile-based%20movement%20in%20game%20with%20Kontra.md).
